    // => get a clean state of cast input and cursor positions

    // cast skills should fire projectiles/damageShapes that can trigger effects

    // => spawning is always a point
    // => traveling is a line
    // => projectiles are the shape along this line

    // fix screenPosition calculation for not having a click input
